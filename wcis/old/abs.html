<p class=stp1bi>Quantum Cryptography: the Past, the Present and the Future</p>
For ages, mathematicians have searched for a system that would allow two people
to exchange messages with absolute confidentiality.  Around the middle of last
century, Shannon proved that this dream is possible if and only if the
legitimate participants share a random secret key as long as the message
they wish to transmit.  But Shannon's theorem did not take account of the
quantum world in which we live.  When information is appropriately encoded
as quantum states, any attempt from an eavesdropper to access it yields
partial information at best and entails a probability of spoiling it
irreversibly.  This unavoidable disturbance can be detected by the
legitimate users.  This phenomenon can be exploited to implement a
cryptographic system that is unconditionally secure even against an
eavesdropper with unlimited computing power and technology, with no need
for a long shared secret key.  Sophisticated prototypes have been built
round the world, over tens of kilometres of ordinary optical fibre as well
as line-of-sight optical paths, and hundreds of kilometres are within reach.
Satellite-based implementations are being contemplated.  Quantum cryptographic
products have become commercially available in the past few years.
<p>
In this talk, I shall provide a personal historical perspective on quantum
cryptography.  I shall also discuss the present and the future of the field.
<p>
No prior knowledge of cryptography quantum mechanics will be assumed.

<p class=stp1bi>Private Searching On Streaming Data</p>
In this talk, I will describe the problem of private searching on streaming
data, where we can efficiently implement searching for documents under a
secret criteria (such as presence or absence of a hidden combination of
hidden keywords) under various cryptographic assumptions. The result can be
viewed in a variety of ways: as a generalization of the notion of a Private
Information Retrieval (to the more general queries and to a streaming
environment as well as to public-key program obfuscation); as positive
results on privacy-preserving data mining; and as a delegation of hidden
program computation to other machines.
<p>
The talk will be self-contained and accessible for the general
computer-science audience.  Joint work with William Skeith.

<p class=stp1bi>On Extractors, Error-Correction and Hiding All Partial Information</p>
Randomness extractors allow one to obtain nearly perfect randomness
from highly imperfect sources randomness, which are only known to
contain "scattered" entropy. Not surprisingly, such extractors have
found numerous applications in many areas of computer science
including cryptography.  Aside from extracting randomness, a less
known usage of extractors comes from the fact that they hide all
deterministic functions of their (high-entropy) input: in other words,
extractors provide certain level of privacy for the imperfect source
that they use.  In the latter kind of applications, one typically
needs extra properties of extractors, such as invertibility,
collision-resistance or error-correction. 
<p>
In this abstract we survey some of such usages of extractors,
concentrating on several recent results by the speaker. The primitives
we will survey include several flavors of randomness extractors,
entropically secure encryption and perfect one-way hash functions. The
main technical tools will include several variants of the leftover
hash lemma, error correcting codes, and the connection between
randomness extraction and hiding all partial information.

<p class=stp1bi>Secure Cooperation without Mutual Trust</p>
In classical cryptography, two (or more) parties want to
protect openly communicated information against an external
adversary. In contrast, there are many applications where
the adversarial threat does not come from outside but from
the involved parties themselves.
<p>
Consider the case where Aiko wants to buy some digital goods
from Benjiro over the Internet. When both parties are honest
then, naturally, Aiko will get the goods and Benjiro will
get the money. However, in case Benjiro is dishonest, he
might collect the money without sending the promised goods
to Aiko. Conversely, in case Aiko is dishonest, she might
take her goods but not deliver the money. Is there a way out
of this problem?
<p>
Another example is playing Poker over the Internet. How to
guarantee that none of the players can cheat? An obvious
solution is to have a trusted central "game provider." But
what if the provider himself is dishonest?
<p>
The given problems are instances of so-called "secure
multi-party computation." This presentation gives a playful
introduction into secure multi-party computation as well as
into conceptual solutions to the problem.
